# 1. Set lo and hi to be inclusive within list index positions of 0 and len(A)â€“1.
# 2. Continue as long as there is at least one value to explore.
# 3. Find midpoint value, A[mid], of remaining range A[lo .. hi].
# 4. If target is smaller than A[mid], continue looking to the left of mid.
# 5. If target is larger than A[mid], continue looking to the right of mid.
# 6. If target is found, return True.
# 7. Once lo is greater than hi, there are no values remaining to search. Report that
#    target is not in A.
