# Challenge Exercise 6

"""
A galactic algorithm is an algorithm whose time complexity is better than any
known algorithm when the problem instance size is “sufficiently large.” For
example, the N-digit multiplication algorithm (published November 2020) by
David Harvey and Joris Van Der Hoeven has O(N log N) runtime performance,
once N is larger than 2Z, where Z is 1729**12; this exponent, Z, is already an astro
nomically large number, about 7*10**38. Consider now raising 2 to this incredibly
large number! Do some research on other galactic algorithms. While these algo
rithms are not practical, they do offer hope that breakthroughs are possible on
some really challenging problems.
