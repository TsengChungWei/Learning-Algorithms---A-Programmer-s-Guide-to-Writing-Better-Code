# Challenge Exercise 7

"""
Table 2-1 contains three rows of performance measurements on three data sets of
different sizes. If you only had two rows of performance measurements, would it
be possible to predict the performance of a quadratic time algorithm? In general,
if you have K rows of performance measurements, what is the highest polynomial
you can effectively use in a model?
